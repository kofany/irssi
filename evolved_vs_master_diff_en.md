# Evolved Irssi vs Master Irssi - Detailed Feature Comparison

## üöÄ Sidepanel System (Main Innovation)

**Description**: Complete sidepanel system with modular architecture and intelligent management.

- **Modularity**: Separate modules for core, layout, rendering, activity and signals
- **Intelligent Redrawing**: Granular refresh of only left/right panel instead of entire screen
- **Batching Mass Events**: Hybrid batching system for mass join/part events (400+ users)
- **Multi-Server Support**: Alphabetical server sorting with proper server tags
- **Kicked Channel Preservation**: Maintains channel labels after being kicked with maximum priority

## üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Gesture System

**Description**: Intuitive navigation between IRC windows by dragging mouse in chat area.

- **4 Gesture Types**: Short/long swipes left/right with configurable actions
- **Intelligent Recognition**: Active only in chat area, not in sidepanels
- **SGR Protocol**: Advanced mouse motion tracking with precise drag event detection
- **Optimized Defaults**: Default mappings tailored to typical IRC usage patterns
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable sensitivity and timeout for gestures

## üé® Enhanced Nick Display System

**Description**: Advanced nick formatting system with alignment, truncation and coloring.

- **Dynamic Alignment**: Intelligent alignment with configurable columns
- **Smart Truncation**: Truncation of long nicks with "+" indicator
- **Hash-Based Coloring**: Consistent colors per nick per channel with configurable palettes
- **Mode Color Separation**: Separate colors for user statuses (op/voice/normal)
- **Real-Time Updates**: All formatting applied dynamically during display

## üì∫ Whois in Active Window

**Description**: Display whois responses directly in active chat window instead of separate one.

- **Context Preservation**: No context switching during whois checks
- **Improved Workflow**: Smoother workflow during conversations
- **Backward Compatible**: Can be disabled to return to standard behavior
- **Clean Integration**: Natural integration into existing interface
- **Message Level Filtering**: Proper message levels for different response types

## ü™ü Intelligent Window Management

**Description**: Automatic creation of Notices and server separator windows for better organization.

- **Notices Window**: Window #1 programmatically set as "Notices" with level `NOTICES|CLIENTNOTICE|CLIENTCRAP|CLIENTERROR`
- **Auto Server Windows**: Automatic creation of server status windows on connect with level `ALL -NOTICES -CLIENTNOTICE -CLIENTCRAP -CLIENTERROR`
- **Message Separation**: System messages (help, errors, command output) go to Notices, IRC traffic to server windows
- **Sidepanel Separators**: Server windows serve as visual separators in left sidepanel with proper servertags
- **Immortal & Sticky**: Notices is immortal, server windows are sticky to respective connections

## üéØ New /window lastone Command

**Description**: Addition of missing command to go to actually last window in list.

- **Missing Functionality**: Command that strangely didn't exist in original irssi despite obvious need
- **Gesture Integration**: Key for mouse gesture system (long right swipe)
- **True Last Window**: Goes to window with highest refnum, not last active like `/window last`
- **IRC Workflow**: Perfect for quickly jumping to end of window list where activity often happens
- **Consistent Behavior**: Behaves predictably - always goes to highest numbered window

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

**Description**: Performance optimizations focused on reducing unnecessary refresh operations.

- **Granular Redraws**: Functions `redraw_left_panels_only()` and `redraw_right_panels_only()`
- **Event-Specific Updates**: Updates only relevant panels for specific events
- **Batch Processing**: Grouping of mass events with timer fallback and immediate sync triggers
- **Safety Checks**: Protection against errors during window creation/destruction
- **Debug Logging**: Debug logging system with file output for diagnostics

## üîß Enhanced Build System

**Description**: Modern build system with automatic dependency management.

- **Meson + Ninja**: Fast, reliable builds with comprehensive dependency management
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for macOS and Linux distributions
- **Auto-Installation**: Automatic detection and installation of all required packages
- **Feature Complete**: Perl scripting, OTR messaging, UTF8proc, SSL/TLS out of the box
- **Dual Mode**: Installation as `irssi` (replacement) or `erssi` (independent coexistence)

## üé® Premium Themes Collection

**Description**: High-quality theme collection with advanced statusbar configurations.

- **Nexus Steel Theme**: Modern cyberpunk theme with advanced configurations
- **Enhanced Default**: Improved version of classic irssi theme with better readability
- **Colorless Theme**: Minimalist theme for terminals with limited color support
- **iTerm2 Integration**: Premium `material-erssi.itermcolors` color scheme
- **Auto-Installation**: Automatic copying of themes to `~/.erssi/` on first startup

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Philosophy

**All new features are enabled by default** - this is the design intent of Evolved Irssi project. Every feature can be disabled through appropriate `/set` setting, but by default everything is active so users immediately experience the full capabilities.

**Compatibility Preservation**: We strived to maintain compatibility with irssi code conventions, theme standards, and overall project architecture. All changes are implemented as extensions, not modifications of existing functionality.

## üèóÔ∏è Module Architecture
